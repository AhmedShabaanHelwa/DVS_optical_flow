# DVS_optical_flow
in this repository different event-based optical flow algorithms are developped 
- direction selection filter 
- lucas kanade adapted method with different variants
- local plance fit with different variants

note that: for each dataset, attention should be given to dt chosen and the thresholds of the algorithms
